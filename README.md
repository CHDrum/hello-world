# hello-world

# Hi Everyone!

# I'm an individual that possesses a large spectrum of research, analytical, and quantitative skills with an ability to perform statistical analysis on large data sets, run linear regressions, and construct various data models. I have an excellent understanding of business operations, advanced mathematics, machine learning, predictive analytics, financial statements, ratio analysis, stock market fluctuations, and many economic principles. I mostly like to code in R, but I would like to improve my Python programming skills as well.

# On my spare time, I like to write and play music, stay healthy and fit, play sports, read books, and spend time with friends and family.
